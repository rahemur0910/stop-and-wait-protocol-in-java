// Server.java
This Java code represents a simple server that uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for communication. Unlike TCP, UDP is connectionless and does not establish a continuous connection between the client and server. Instead, it sends data packets, called datagrams, independently. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Imports necessary Java I/O and networking classes.
Defines a class named Server.
In the main method:
Creates a DatagramSocket object bound to port 9876. This socket will be used for sending and receiving datagrams.
Defines byte arrays receiveData and sendData to hold data received from clients and data to be sent to clients, respectively.
Prints a message indicating that the server has started and is waiting for clients.
Enters a continuous loop to receive datagrams from clients.
Inside the loop:
Creates a DatagramPacket receivePacket to receive data from clients. This packet will be filled with data received from clients.
Invokes the receive() method on the server socket to wait for incoming datagrams. This call blocks until a datagram is received.
Extracts the data from the received packet and converts it to a string.
Prints the received message from the client.
Retrieves the client's address and port from the received packet.
Prepares a response message (in this case, appending "ACK: " to the received message).
Converts the response message to bytes and creates a new DatagramPacket sendPacket with the response message, client address, and port.
Sends the response datagram to the client using the send() method on the server socket.
Overall, this server listens for UDP datagrams from clients, processes them, and sends back acknowledgment messages to the clients. It operates in a loop, continuously receiving and responding to datagrams until an exception occurs.

//Client.java

This Java code represents a simple client that uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for communication with a server. Let's break down what each part of the code does:

Imports: Importing necessary Java I/O and networking classes.

Client Class: Defines a class named Client.

Main Method: The entry point of the program.

Socket Initialization:

Creates a DatagramSocket object clientSocket. Unlike TCP, where you specify the server's address and port when creating the socket, UDP sockets can be created without any specific address or port. The system assigns a local port number for the client socket.
Server Address and Port:

InetAddress serverAddress is set to localhost, indicating that the server is running on the same machine.
serverPort is set to 9876, the port number the server is listening on.
Data Buffers:

sendData and receiveData byte arrays are initialized to hold data to be sent to the server and data received from the server, respectively.
User Input:

A BufferedReader inFromUser is set up to read input from the console.
The user is prompted to enter a message to send to the server using System.out.print().
The entered message is read using readLine() and stored in the message variable.
Sending Data to Server:

The message entered by the user is converted to bytes and stored in sendData.
A DatagramPacket sendPacket is created with the data to send, server address, and port.
The send() method of clientSocket is called to send the packet to the server.
Receiving Response from Server:

A new DatagramPacket receivePacket is created to receive data from the server.
The receive() method of clientSocket is called to wait for a packet from the server.
The received data is stored in receiveData.
The received data is converted to a string, trimmed (to remove leading and trailing whitespace), and stored in the response variable.
Output:

The received response from the server is printed to the console.
Socket Closure:
The clientSocket is closed to release the associated resources after communication is finished.
This client sends a single message to the server, waits for a response, and then exits. In a real-world scenario, you might want to implement a loop to send and receive multiple messages or handle errors and exceptions more robustly.
